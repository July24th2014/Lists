# Lists

Suppose you are given two linked lists of integers, the values in which are non-decreasing (e.g., 1 -> 3 -> 5 and 2 -> 4 -> 6).

Try to implement a method to merge these two lists by splicing together their nodes so that we can get a sorted list that contains all elements (e.g., 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6).

Inputs: the header nodes of two sorted linked lists;
Outputs: the header node of the merged linked list.
Note: The ListNode class is provided in the template file. Please keep it when you submit the code. Also, please don't modify other existing class/method headers in the template file.

Hints: Consider edge cases (e.g., null inputs).
